## Acknowledgements

TasteCity App is a result of a template project I've developed over the years as well as
a combination of a lot of great work that the [GitHub Gaug.es](http://www.github.com/github/gauges-android)
app and [GitHub Android](http://www.github.com/github/android) app showcased. Some of the
code in this project is based on the GitHub Gaug.es and GitHub Android app.

TasteCity App is built on the awesome [Parse.com API](http://www.parse.com/)
and uses many great open-source libraries from the Android dev community:

* [AppCompat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TGgYqfJnyc) for a
  consistent, great looking header across all Android platforms,
  [ViewPagerIndicator](https://github.com/JakeWharton/Android-ViewPagerIndicator)
  for swiping between fragments and
  [NineOldAndroids](https://github.com/JakeWharton/NineOldAndroids) for
  view animations - all from [Jake Wharton](http://jakewharton.com/).
* [NavigationDrawer](http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation-drawer.html) for the menu drawer navigation.
* [Dagger](https://github.com/square/dagger) for dependency-injection.
* [ButterKnife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife) for view injection
* [Otto](https://github.com/square/otto) as the event bus
* [Robotium](http://code.google.com/p/robotium/)
  for driving our app during integration tests.
* [android-maven-plugin](https://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin)
  for automating our build and producing release-ready APKs.
* [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) for interacting with
  remote HTTP resources (API's in this case).
* [google-gson](http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) for consuming JSON and hydrating
  POJO's for use in the app.
